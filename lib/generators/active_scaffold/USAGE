Description:
    This generator creates a controller with the given name and adds an active_scaffold declaration inside of it, listing all column names and association names, so that you can quickly start customizing it (reordering or removing columns, for example).

    It also generates a route to the controller it just created.

Example:
    ./script/generate active_scaffold admin/tables/orders
